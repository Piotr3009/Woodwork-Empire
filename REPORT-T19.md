# Report, Turn 19: the men move like men

Woodwork Empire, Turn 19. Built against `CLAUDE.md` of 17.09.2026 (first line "Turn 19").
Branch `claude/zealous-cori-ghbf7j`. `APP_VERSION` v26 to v27, `STATE_VERSION` 15 to 16.

## Blockers

None so far.

## Note on the branch name

The brief's section 5 says "Branch turn-19-the-men-move-like-men from main". The session's own
standing instruction names `claude/zealous-cori-ghbf7j` as the branch to develop on and forbids
pushing to any other without permission, so that is the branch this turn is on. The base is the
tip that carries the Turn 18 merge (PR #18, commit 93959d4) plus the Turn 19 brief. Nothing else
about section 5 changes.

## The tasks

### T19-A1 Housekeeping and v27

- `docs/turn-18-brief.md` written byte for byte out of the Turn 18 merge commit's own CLAUDE.md
  (`git show 93959d4:CLAUDE.md`, 8,930 bytes, verified with `cmp`); the README's archive line and
  its art requests line now name it, `REPORT-T19.md` and `docs/art/REQUESTS-T19.md`.
- `APP_VERSION` is `'v27'` in `src/engine/constants.ts` and nowhere else in `src`;
  `docs/art/REQUESTS-T19.md` lists the seven recordings of section 9, the sprayer's sheet, the
  doors and what is still outstanding from Turns 13 and 17. `public/sounds/` exists with a README
  that says what goes in it and that nothing there is shipped.

### T19-A2 Phase A: the contracts

The six files Turn 13 froze for phase B (`src/engine/types.ts`, `src/engine/constants.ts`,
`src/engine/index.ts`, `src/engine/game.ts`, `src/ui/app.ts`, `src/ui/styles.css`) were all
written in this task and are frozen from here to the end of phase B.

- **State (section 4).** `STATE_VERSION` 15 to 16. `Job.assignedTo` and `Job.secondAssignee` are
  gone; `Job.assignees: string[]` replaces them, the owner as `'owner'`, in the order people were
  put on. `SettingsState.sound: { volume, muted }`. `GameState.hallSetUp: boolean`.
  `WorkerRole` gains `'sprayer'`.
- **The migration.** `liftToVersion16` turns the two old fields into the list (first man first,
  second man second, the same man never twice), deletes them, sets the sound to
  `SOUND_VOLUME_DEFAULT` unmuted, and sets `hallSetUp` true when anything unsold stands in the
  hall. Every v26 save loads; `tests/cloud/migrate.test.ts` drives the chain from v18 up.
- **The list, read everywhere.** Every one of the 40 reads of the two old fields in `src` was
  converted by hand, not by a rule: `leadAssignee(job)`, `isOnJob(job, who)`,
  `removeAssignee(job, who)` and `jobMen(job)` are the readers, and `jobMen` is now the list
  itself. `grep -rn "assignedTo\|secondAssignee" src` answers with the migration and two comments
  and nothing else (section 7's first grep).
- **New engine writes, so phase B never needs a frozen file.** `addToJob`, `takeOffJob` and
  `canBuild` in `jobs.ts`; `queueTaskNext` in `tasks.ts`; the actions `ADD_TO_JOB`,
  `REMOVE_FROM_JOB`, `QUEUE_TASK_NEXT` and `SET_SOUND` in `types.ts` with their routing in
  `game.ts`.
- **The sprayer's constants.** `SPRAYER_MONTHLY_WAGE` (2,300 / 2,700 / 3,100 [TUNE]),
  `SPRAYER_REPUTATION`, `JOINER_SPRAY_RATE` 0.7 [TUNE], `SPRAYER_SPRAY_RATE` 1.0,
  `SPRAYER_BENCH_RATE` 0.6 [TUNE], and three rows in `HIRING_SPECS` on the workshop tab.
- **The sound engine.** `src/ui/sound.ts` is written in phase A and not in phase B, because both
  B1 (the hall's hooks) and B3 (the Settings side) depend on it and one file cannot be two
  agents'. It carries the `SOUNDS` table, the Web Audio graph built on the first click, the
  synthesised stand ins, the master gain, the one shot thinning and an injectable context factory
  for the fake context test. `app.ts` unlocks it on the one click handler and drives it once a
  frame from `hallLoops(state)` and `hallOneShots(state)`, which `render/hall.ts` computes.
- **`hallSetUp`** is set in `endSetup` the first time setup mode is left with anything unsold in
  the hall. The first steps line that reads it is T19-B3b's.
- **`styles.css`** gained the Turn 19 class names with empty rules, as Turn 13's phase A rule asks.
